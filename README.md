# @emqx/shared-ui

This repository is the home of `@emqx/shared-ui`, a centralized UI component library designed to enable consistent user interface elements across EMQX products such as EMQX Dashboard and EMQX Cloud. By fostering a shared codebase, our aim is to streamline the development process, encourage code reuse, and maintain a uniform experience for users across different EMQX platforms.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Our goal is to abstract common UI components, utilities, and theming variables that can be reused in various EMQX projects, reducing redundancy and facilitating a more efficient front-end development workflow.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

Components from `@emqx/shared-ui` can be easily imported into EMQX Dashboard, EMQX Cloud, or any other EMQX web application, ensuring a coherent look and feel while allowing for customization when necessary.
